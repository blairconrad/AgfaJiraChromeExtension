Agfa Jira is a Google Chrome extension that augments Jira issue pages. 

## Actions

You can access several actions via the extension icon,
or by using keyboard shortcuts.  The default shortcuts are listed
below:

* Email issue <kbd>Alt+S</kbd> (mnemonic: "send")
* Copy Link as Markdown <kbd>Alt+L</kbd>
* Copy Title <kbd>Alt+T</kbd>

You can always choose your own shortcuts at the bottom of the Chrome
Extensions page.

## Comment-sorting

Jira's issue comment-sorting is globally configured on the server, not
on a per-user basis. The extension allows you to set a preferred sort
order (oldest first or newest first) that will be used whenever you
login. Set your preferred order in the extension's options, accessible
on the Chrome Extensions page or by right-clicking the extension's icon.

----
The extension is tied to the Jira server at Agfa Healthcare, so won't work on
other Jira instances.
